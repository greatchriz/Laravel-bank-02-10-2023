php artisan make:livewire SearchAccountNumber


Listening for specific keys
You can use one of Livewire's convenient aliases to narrow down key press event listeners to a specific key or combination of keys.

For example, to perform a search when a user hits Enter after typing into a search box, you can use wire:keydown.enter:

<input wire:model="query" wire:keydown.enter="searchPosts">
